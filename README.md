# Interactive games for Museum of Republic of Srpska

I was worked in a small team, where we created three interactive games inspired by plants, within the project "Use of medicinal herbs in folk medicine" organized by the Museum of Republika Srpska. 

Games are available at this [link](https://bogdanvjestica.github.io/muzej-rs/index.html).
